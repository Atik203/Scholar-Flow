# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: ScholarFlow  
**Type**: AI-Powered Research Paper Collaboration Hub  
**Architecture**: Monorepo with Next.js frontend and Express.js backend  
**Phase**: Phase 1 Development (MVP) - Authentication Complete ✅  
**Project Start**: August 2025  
**Developer**: Md. Atikur Rahaman (GitHub: Atik203)

## Core Standards

### Package Manager & Environment

- **Package Manager**: Use Yarn Berry (v4). Never use npm in this repo.
- **Development**: Use `yarn dev:turbo` to run frontend and backend
- **Environment**: Check for any .env file changes, document new environment variables
- **Ports**: Frontend 3000, Backend 5000

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI + Redux Toolkit Query + NextAuth.js
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM + JWT + bcrypt
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for AI features

## ✅ Major Recent Completions

**Paper Management System (September 17, 2025):** Complete paper upload, storage, and management system with S3 integration, PDF processing, metadata extraction, advanced search functionality, and modern UI/UX.

**OAuth Authentication System:** Production-ready with Google/GitHub OAuth, JWT management, comprehensive error handling, and full integration test suite (5/5 tests passing).

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style & Patterns

1. **TypeScript First**: All code must be properly typed, no implicit `any`
2. **File Naming Convention**: Use dot notation for module files: `module.type.ts` (e.g., `auth.controller.ts`, `user.service.ts`, `paper.validation.ts`, `paper.routes.ts`)
3. **Error Handling**: Use catchAsync wrapper and ApiError class consistently
4. **Validation**: Use Zod for all input validation, never trust client data
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests for critical features (auth, payments, data integrity)
6. **Authentication**: Use standard Prisma upsert for OAuth account management
7. **Database**: Prefer Prisma Client over raw SQL; document any raw queries with warnings
8. **Security**: Hide secrets; strict CORS; secure cookies; input sanitization
9. **Performance**: Paginate, index DB queries, cache hot reads
10. **Git hygiene**: Conventional commits, small PRs, descriptive titles, linked issues

### Phase 1 MVP Features (Current Priority)

1. **User Authentication & Profile Management** ✅
   - Sign up/login with Google OAuth + email/password ✅
   - User profile management ✅
   - Password reset functionality ✅

2. **Paper Upload & Storage** ✅
   - File processing and text extraction ✅
   - S3 cloud storage integration ✅
   - PDF metadata extraction ✅

   - Add/remove papers from collections
   - Share collections with other users
   - Basic permission management
   - Advanced search and filtering ✅

## Important Commands

```bash
# Bootstrap
yarn install

# Development
yarn dev:turbo

# Database
yarn db:migrate   # Run database migrations
yarn db:generate  # Generate Prisma client + TypedSQL

# Quality Checks

## Roadmap Discipline

- Always consult `Roadmap.md` and work sequentially: complete Phase 1 before Phase 2, then Phase 3
- When proposing changes, map them to the current phase; defer out-of-phase work to "Next steps"
- Prefer small PRs that align with the current milestone; avoid mixing cross-phase scope in one change

## Documentation Update Protocol

When making significant changes to authentication, UI/UX, or core patterns:

1. Update relevant `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` files with new patterns
2. Update `.github/instructions/*.md` files with implementation guidance
3. Update `docs/UI_DESIGN.md` for any UI changes or new component patterns
4. Update `Roadmap.md` to reflect completion status
5. Add feature flags to both backend and frontend `.env.example` files
6. Update main `README.md` only for major milestones or architecture changes
