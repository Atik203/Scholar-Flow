- **üõ°Ô∏è Resilience & Monitoring**: Duplicate-event filtering, structured webhook logs, and failure tracking for future replay tooling.

### Technical Summary ‚Äì v1.1.6

#### Stripe Billing Platform

- Checkout sessions embed workspace, plan tier, and price IDs to support granular billing per workspace.
- Webhook pipeline verifies signatures, stores payloads in `WebhookEvent`, and processes `checkout.session.completed`, subscription lifecycle, and invoice events.
- Billing errors normalized through `BillingError` with feature-specific codes, feeding the global API error handler.
- Subscription state machine updates Prisma `Subscription` records and enforces role mapping via `getRoleFromPriceId`.

#### Frontend Subscription Experience

- Dashboard billing route (`/dashboard/billing`) shows current plan, upcoming renewals, and links to Stripe portal.
- Success and cancel routes deliver contextual messaging after checkout while refreshing session state.
- Shared billing components provide CTA buttons, pricing tables, and stateful loading feedback backed by RTK Query.
- Navigation highlights Billing in the sidebar for all authenticated roles with permission-aware visibility.

#### Reliability & Monitoring

- Idempotent webhook handling prevents double processing via `WebhookEvent` lookups.
- Background retries on failed payloads increment attempt counters and log structured failures for reprocessing.
- Rate limiting on billing endpoints piggybacks existing middleware to protect webhook and checkout flows.
- Development-only debug logging keeps production output clean while supporting local tracing.
