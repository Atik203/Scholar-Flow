# 🔴 Critical Issue Identified!

## Problem Summary

After successful login (both Google OAuth and credentials), the JWT callback works perfectly, but **the session callback is NEVER called when `useSession()` requests the session**.

## Evidence from Logs

```
✅ JWT CALLBACK CALLED - Token created
✅ POST /api/auth/callback/credentials 200
✅ GET /dashboard 200  <-- Dashboard initially loads
❌ Session callback NOT called
❌ GET /login?callbackUrl=%2Fdashboard  <-- Redirected back to login
```

## Root Cause

The issue is that after successful authentication:

1. JWT is created ✅
2. User is redirected to dashboard ✅
3. Dashboard tries to get session via `useSession()` ✅
4. `useSession()` calls `/api/auth/session` ✅
5. **Session callback is NOT triggered** ❌
6. `useSession()` returns `status: "unauthenticated"` ❌
7. `useAuthGuard` sees unauthenticated status and redirects to `/login` ❌

## Why Session Callback Isn't Firing

Possible reasons:

1. **JWT token not being sent with `/api/auth/session` request**
2. **Cookie not being set properly after login**
3. **NextAuth configuration issue with JWT strategy**
4. **Missing or invalid session token cookie**

## Immediate Fix Required

Need to verify:

1. Is the `next-auth.session-token` cookie being set after login?
2. Is the cookie being sent with subsequent requests?
3. Is NextAuth able to decode the JWT from the cookie?

## Testing Steps

1. After login, check browser DevTools → Application → Cookies
2. Look for `next-auth.session-token`
3. Check if it has a value
4. Check Network tab for `/api/auth/session` request
5. Verify the cookie is sent with that request

## Quick Fix to Try

The login page is using `window.location.href = redirectUrl` which should work, but NextAuth might not have finished setting the cookie before the redirect happens.

Try adding a small delay or force a session update after redirect.
