## 4. Motivation

### Why We Built ScholarFlow

The development of ScholarFlow was driven by several key challenges faced by modern researchers and academic professionals:

#### 🎯 **Primary Motivations**

- **Fragmented Research Tools**
  - Researchers juggle multiple tools for different tasks (Mendeley for references, Dropbox for storage, Slack for collaboration)
  - No single platform integrates paper management, AI insights, and team collaboration
  - Switching between applications disrupts workflow and reduces productivity

- **Poor Paper Organization**
  - Traditional file systems don't scale well for large paper collections
  - Difficult to search and retrieve papers based on content or metadata
  - No intelligent categorization or recommendation systems

- **Limited Collaboration Features**
  - Existing tools lack real-time collaboration on research notes and annotations
  - Sharing papers and collections is cumbersome and insecure
  - No role-based access control for team workspaces

- **Manual Metadata Extraction**
  - Manually entering paper titles, authors, and abstracts is time-consuming
  - Error-prone data entry leads to inconsistent metadata
  - No automated extraction from PDF/DOCX files

- **Lack of AI Integration**
  - Reading lengthy academic papers is time-intensive
  - Extracting key insights requires manual note-taking
  - No intelligent question-answering about paper contents

- **Citation Management Complexity**
  - Managing citations in multiple formats (BibTeX, APA, MLA, IEEE) is tedious
  - Exporting and formatting citations for different journals is error-prone
  - No centralized citation history or management

- **Accessibility & Cost Barriers**
  - Commercial research tools are expensive for students and individual researchers
  - Free alternatives lack essential features or have usage limits
  - No flexible pricing model for different user needs

   - Navigates to `/papers/[id]`
   - Backend fetches paper with `$queryRaw` including file info and chunks
   - Page displays:
     - Title, authors, abstract
     - Upload date, file size, page count
     - PDF preview (iframe with S3 presigned URL, 30-min expiry)
     - Download button (generates new presigned URL)
     - Edit metadata button (for paper owner)
     - Add to collection button
     - AI summary section (lazy loaded)

   - Backend soft-deletes paper (sets `isDeleted` = true)
   - Associated records updated (`PaperFile`, `PaperChunk`, `CollectionPaper`)
   - S3 file not immediately deleted (retention policy)
   - User redirected to papers list

**Database Tables Involved**:

- `Paper` - Paper metadata and processing status
- `PaperFile` - S3 file location and metadata

   - Results include similarity score

4. **Search History**
   - All searches logged in `SearchHistory` table
   - User can view past searches in profile settings
   - Click on past search to re-run with same filters
   - History limited to 50 most recent searches

**SQL Query Example**:

```sql
SELECT
  p.id, p.title, p.abstract, p."createdAt",
  u.name as "uploaderName",
  COUNT(cp."collectionId") as "collectionCount"
FROM "Paper" p
LEFT JOIN "User" u ON p."uploaderId" = u.id
LEFT JOIN "CollectionPaper" cp ON cp."paperId" = p.id AND cp."isDeleted" = false
WHERE p."isDeleted" = false
  AND p."workspaceId" = $1
