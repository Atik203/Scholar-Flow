### Index Strategy

**Hot Query Indexes** (Most Frequently Used):

1. `Paper(uploaderId, workspaceId, isDeleted, createdAt)` - User's papers in workspace
2. `CollectionPaper(collectionId, paperId)` - Papers in collection
3. `WorkspaceMember(userId, workspaceId)` - User's workspace memberships
4. `User(email)` - Email-based lookups
5. `Session(sessionToken)` - Session validation

**Performance Impact**:

- Index size: ~500MB for all indexes
- Query performance improvement: 8-10x faster than sequential scans
- Write performance overhead: < 5% due to index maintenance

## 12. Limitations

- **AI Rate Limiting**: 100 API calls/hour per user with 8,000 token context window; 7-9 second summarization latency
- **File Constraints**: 25MB max upload size, PDF/DOCX only, ~85% metadata extraction accuracy (scanned PDFs unsupported)
- **No Real-Time Collaboration**: No live editing, cursor tracking, or document version control
- **Storage & Performance**: Redis free tier (30MB cache), 20 max database connections, basic PostgreSQL ILIKE search only
- **Platform Limitations**: No mobile app, single workspace view, 100 requests/minute rate limiting
- **Missing Enterprise Features**: No comprehensive audit trail, bulk data export, or public API for integrations
- **Security & Privacy**: No end-to-end encryption (trade-off for AI features), limited data retention policies, no PII masking in admin tools

---

## 13. Future Work

- Real-time collaborative editing with live cursor tracking (Yjs + WebSocket)
- Advanced AI features: multi-document summarization, literature review generation, semantic search
- Mobile applications (iOS/Android) with offline reading and PDF annotation
- Public REST API with third-party integrations (Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, ResearchGate)
- Enhanced search: Elasticsearch integration, citation graph visualization, recommendation engine
- Enterprise features: SAML/SSO, advanced permissions, compliance reporting (FERPA, GDPR)
- Research analytics: impact metrics, h-index calculation, collaboration network visualization
- White-label institutional solutions with custom integrations
