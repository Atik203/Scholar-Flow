## üß© Architecture Snapshot

Monorepo (Yarn Berry + Turbo) with:

- `apps/frontend`: Next.js 15 (App Router, Tailwind, ShadCN, NextAuth, RTK Query)
- `apps/backend`: Express + TypeScript + Prisma (Postgres + pgvector)
- `packages/*`: Shared types / SEO utilities

Workers will process ingestion (OCR, embeddings) via a queue

## üéØ Product Overview

Scholar-Flow helps researchers and teams:

- Ingest & organize academic papers
- Generate AI summaries & semantic retrieval
- Annotate & collaborate in collections
- Explore citation relationships
- Manage access, billing, and usage

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture (High Level)

Frontend (Next.js) ‚Üî Backend (Express/Prisma) ‚Üî Postgres (pgvector)  
Optional Worker (embeddings/OCR) ‚Üê queue (Redis)  
Object storage (S3/R2) for PDFs.  
Feature flags gate unfinished surfaces (see example env files).

## üì¶ Core Feature Domains

| Domain                | Highlights (Current / Planned)                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Paper Ingestion       | Upload, metadata extraction, queued processing (OCR/embeddings) |
| Collections           | Organize papers, future sharing & activity feed                 |
| Semantic Intelligence | pgvector-backed search (flagged until data + embeddings)        |
| Annotations           | Placeholder now ‚Üí full highlight + realtime threads             |
| Citation Intelligence | Graph + formatting (Phase 2+)                                   |
| AI Assistance         | Summaries, suggestions (progressive rollout)                    |
| Billing & Plans       | Stripe + SSLCommerz integration (Phase 3)                       |
| Admin & Governance    | User management, metrics, moderation (Phase 3)                  |

## 4) Detailed Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind, ShadCN, Framer Motion; Forms with RHF + Zod; State with RTK Query + light UI slice.
- Backend API: Node.js, Express.js, Prisma ORM; Zod for input validation; Helmet, CORS; RBAC middleware by role and workspace membership.
- Workers: Node.js with BullMQ (Redis) for ingest/OCR/embeddings/AI tasks.
- Database: Postgres + Prisma; pgvector for embeddings (stored as Unsupported("vector") in Prisma, queried via raw SQL).
- AI: OpenAI, HuggingFace, LangChain, Tesseract.
- Storage: S3-compatible (R2/S3/MinIO) with signed URLs.
- Payments: Stripe SDK; SSLCommerz (sslcommerz-lts).
- DevOps: Vercel (frontend); Railway/Render/Fly.io (backend + workers); Redis for queues/cache.

## 5) Authentication & Authorization

- Auth.js (NextAuth) on the frontend app; JWT session strategy.
- Backend validates JWT (bearer) with shared secret; extracts userId and role.
- Workspace-based access: WorkspaceMember role gates access to papers/collections inside a workspace.
- Collection-level sharing for granular collaboration.
- Admin users can manage users, payments, and system settings.

## 6) API Surface (Backend Express)

- Auth
  - POST /auth/session/validate (optional ping) ‚Äì verifies JWT valid/claims
- User Profile Management
  - GET /user/me ‚Äì get current user profile
  - PUT /user/update-profile ‚Äì update personal information with validation
  - DELETE /user/delete-account ‚Äì soft delete account with confirmation
- Papers
  - POST /papers/upload-url ‚Äì get pre-signed upload URL
  - POST /papers/import ‚Äì import by DOI/API providers
  - GET /papers ‚Äì list/filter; supports semantic=true for vector search
  - GET /papers/:id ‚Äì detail with metadata
  - DELETE /papers/:id ‚Äì soft delete
- Annotations
  - GET /papers/:id/annotations
  - POST /papers/:id/annotations
  - GET /papers/:id/annotations/versions

  - POST /collections/:id/papers
  - POST /collections/:id/invite
- Search & AI
  - POST /search/semantic
  - GET /papers/:id/similar
  - POST /papers/:id/ai/summarize
  - POST /papers/:id/ai/citation-suggestions

Security and cross-cutting

- CORS: allow frontend domain; block others by default.
- CSRF: not required for pure bearer APIs; ensure cookie usage is httpOnly/secure if used.
- Rate limiting: per-IP and per-user; stricter on AI endpoints.
- Input validation: Zod schemas on every route; sanitize filters for search.
- Audit logs and notifications for sensitive actions.

## üñ•Ô∏è UI / UX Documentation

**Full UI Design Blueprint:** [`docs/UI_DESIGN.md`](./docs/UI_DESIGN.md)

This document provides:

- Complete screen-by-screen structure and component taxonomy
- Phased UI delivery plan (Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Phase 3)
- Feature flag strategy and accessibility checklist
- Authentication UI patterns and state management
- Component architecture mapping and routing plan

**‚úÖ Phase 1 Authentication UI:** Login, signup, and OAuth flows with comprehensive form validation, error handling, and responsive design.

## 8) Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance: paginate lists; stream large PDFs; index pgvector with ivfflat (cosine).
- Reliability: idempotent payment webhooks; store raw webhook payloads; retries with backoff.
- Background jobs: all heavy tasks (OCR/embeddings) offloaded; job results written back atomically.
- Security: signed URLs for file access; strict RBAC; input validation; secrets management (runtime env).
- Internationalization: i18n-ready; date-fns for formatting.
- Accessibility: keyboard-friendly annotations; ARIA for viewer controls.

## 9) Monetization

- Free: up to 100 papers, basic AI features, no shared collections.
- Pro ($10/mo): unlimited uploads, all AI tools, collaboration, priority queue.
- Institutional: workspace/institution-wide seats and SSO (future).

## 10) Database Schema Reference

The full Prisma data model has been moved to `SCHEMA.md` for clarity.

## 11) Deployment

- Frontend: Vercel project with environment-bound NEXTAUTH_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL.
- Backend: Railway/Render/Fly.io container; set DATABASE_URL, JWT/Auth secrets, Stripe/SSL keys, S3 creds.
- Workers: Same platform as backend, separate process using the same codebase (monorepo) or separate repo.
- Migrations: Prisma migrate on backend deploy; maintain seed scripts for local/dev environments.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Immediate Next Steps (Phase 1)

1. ‚úÖ ~~Finalize Auth + profile endpoints integration~~ **COMPLETED** (Author: Atik)
2. Implement upload ‚Üí ingest pipeline (with placeholder worker path)
3. Add pgvector migration & embeddings service stub (feature-flagged)
4. Collections basic CRUD + association
5. Prepare semantic search API skeleton (disabled until embeddings exist)
