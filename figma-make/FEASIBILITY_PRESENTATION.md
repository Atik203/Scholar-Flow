## **Strategy**

**Lead with AI-powered collaboration workflows and campus-first growth.** Launch beta at UIU (47.4% survey concentration) targeting 100 users with free Pro tier for validation. Emphasize modern UI/UX and AI features to differentiate from incumbents like Zotero and Mendeley. Address privacy concerns through transparent security policies and SOC 2 compliance roadmap. Implement freemium model with generous free tier (100MB, 10 papers/month, 50 AI queries) and clear upgrade path to Pro ($9.99/month) and Team ($29.99/month) tiers. Expand to NSU, AIUB, BRAC universities via campus ambassador program and university partnerships. Focus on "from solo to shared" messaging to convert the 55.2% solo researchers. Mitigate switching costs with one-click import from Zotero/Mendeley. Prove ROI through analytics dashboards showing time savings and productivity gains. Scale to 500 users across 5 universities in Phase 2, then pursue national/international expansion with localization and enterprise contracts in Phase 3.
