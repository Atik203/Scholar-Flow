# ScholarFlow Feasibility Deck Playbook

Turn the 21-question Google Form stored in `ScholarFlow_Feasibility_Survey_Responses.xlsx` into a finished feasibility analysis slide deck inside the `figma-make` project. Every chart already exists as `response_image/<n>.png` (auto-generated by Google). This README tells you exactly what to place on each slide, the talking points, and how to tie the findings back to ScholarFlow’s product strategy.

| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strengths**     | Deep CS-student insight, comprehensive Figma Make UI kit (102 screens), AI-assisted reading already prototyped, strong annotation vision.                                                                               |
| **Weaknesses**    | Limited brand recognition outside UIU cohort, no production privacy posture showcased yet, analytics implementation still theoretical.                                                                                  |
| **Opportunities** | High intent for AI co-pilots, unmet collaboration + analytics needs on campuses, ability to launch free tier funnel ahead of incumbents.                                                                                |
| **Threats**       | Existing habits (Drive, email) are “good enough,” privacy/cost skepticism, fast-moving competitors (Zotero, Notion, Readwise) adding AI.                                                                                |
| **Strategy**      | Lead with collaborative AI workflows + trust messaging, launch campus pilots (UIU, NSU) using free tier, ship analytics & permissions MVP fast, communicate roadmap for referencing/LMS/offline to pre-empt objections. |

## Slide-by-Slide Build Sheet (use charts from `response_image/<n>.png`)

Each entry lists: **Design Direction** (which Figma components/sections to reuse) and **Talking Points** (what to say over the existing chart). Follow order 1–21 so the numbering matches the Google auto-exported images.

### Slide 1 – Audience Role Mix (`response_image/1.png`)

- **Design:** Hero card with donut chart full-width; reuse `sections/Hero` typography, gradient background, and `components/ui/stat` badges for callouts.
- **Talking Points:** 86% undergraduates → ScholarFlow is targeting core campus researchers; small but important slices (faculty, PhD, Masters) validate multi-role support.

### Slide 2 – Field of Study (`response_image/2.png`)

- **Design:** Masonry list with badge chips for each field; use `components/ui/badge` to show CS dominance while nodding to Pharmacy/Civil/Economics.
- **Talking Points:** Emphasize cross-discipline need yet highlight that CS-centric workflows (code, AI) will delight majority.

### Slide 3 – Academic Level (`response_image/3.png`)

- **Design:** Two-column layout from `layout/PageContainer`; left column bar chart, right column quote about “3rd year crunch”.
