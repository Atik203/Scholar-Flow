\section{Core Pain Points}
\label{sec:pain-points}

\subsection{Pain Point 1: Fragmented Paper Storage}
\label{subsec:pain-fragmented-storage}

\begin{warningbox}[The Problem]
\textbf{Current State:} Researchers typically store papers across multiple locations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Local hard drives (prone to data loss)
    \item Cloud services like Google Drive or Dropbox (no metadata)
    \item Email attachments (difficult to organize)
    \item Downloaded from various academic databases
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Impact:} Average researcher wastes 2-3 hours per week searching for previously downloaded papers. A 2024 study found 67\% of researchers have re-downloaded the same paper multiple times.
\end{warningbox}

\begin{successbox}[Our Solution]
\projectname{} provides a \textbf{centralized cloud repository} with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AWS S3 Storage:} Enterprise-grade reliability (99.999999999\% durability)
