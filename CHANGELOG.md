## v1.1.4 (2025-09-30) – Dynamic Admin System Monitoring

Author: @Atik203

### Highlights – v1.1.4

- **Real-Time System Metrics**: Production-grade system monitoring dashboard with 10-second auto-refresh polling
- **Accurate CPU Monitoring**: Intelligent CPU usage calculation using actual idle/total times with load average fallback
- **Smart Storage Tracking**: Dynamic storage calculation based on actual database usage (10x current usage with 100GB minimum)
- **Health Status Dashboard**: Comprehensive health cards for Database, Server, Storage, and CPU with status-based color coding
- **Performance Visualization**: Auto-colored progress bars for CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, and Network metrics
- **System Information Panel**: Real-time display of platform, Node.js version, database version, memory, and uptime
- **Lazy Loading & Code Splitting**: React.lazy with Suspense boundaries for optimal performance
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: HTTP caching (10s), rate limiting, admin-only access, and comprehensive error handling

### Technical Implementation – v1.1.4

#### Backend System Metrics Service

- **Node.js OS Module Integration**: Real CPU metrics using os.cpus(), os.totalmem(), os.freemem(), os.loadavg()
- **Intelligent CPU Calculation**: Calculates actual CPU usage from idle/total times across all cores with fallback to load average
- **Dynamic Storage Estimation**: Estimates total storage as 10x current usage (minimum 100GB) for realistic capacity percentages
- **Database Performance Monitoring**: Tracks active connections, connection pool usage, and query response times
- **Health Status Logic**: Automatic health classification (healthy/degraded/unhealthy/warning/critical) based on thresholds
- **Performance Caching**: 10-second Cache-Control headers for real-time monitoring without overloading system

#### Frontend Real-Time Dashboard

- **RTK Query Integration**: useGetSystemMetricsQuery hook with 10-second polling for automatic updates
- **Reusable Components**: HealthCard (5 status types), PerformanceBar (auto-color), SystemInfoRow with loading states
- **Code Splitting**: React.lazy loading for HealthCard, PerformanceBar, SystemInfoRow components
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Skeleton loaders for smooth loading experience during initial fetch and re-polling
- **Optional Chaining**: Comprehensive null safety with metrics?.performance.cpu.usage?.toFixed(1) patterns
- **Auto-Color Logic**: Performance bars change color based on value (green <50%, blue 50-70%, yellow 70-85%, red >85%)

#### System Metrics Endpoint

- **Route**: GET /api/admin/system/metrics
- **Security**: authMiddleware → requireAdmin → rateLimiter chain
- **Response Structure**: { health, performance, systemInfo, database } with nested metrics
- **Health Monitoring**: Database status, server uptime, storage capacity, CPU load
- **Performance Metrics**: CPU usage/cores/load, memory total/used/free, disk usage/I/O, network bandwidth
