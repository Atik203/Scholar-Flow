\section{Architectural Overview}
\label{sec:architectural-overview}

\projectname{} follows a modular, three-tier architecture consisting of a web client, an API layer, and a persistent data layer.
The system is implemented as a monorepo with a \textbf{Next.js 15} frontend and an \textbf{Express.js} backend.
Data is stored in \textbf{PostgreSQL} and accessed through \textbf{Prisma} using parameterized RAW query patterns where appropriate.
For file storage and large binary objects, the platform integrates \textbf{AWS S3}.

The overall design aims to ensure (i) secure authentication and authorization, (ii) scalable paper processing and retrieval, and (iii) extensibility for AI-driven capabilities such as summarization and semantic search.

\section{Context Diagram}
\label{sec:context-diagram}

The context diagram (Figure~\ref{fig:context-diagram}) presents \projectname{} as a single system boundary and highlights the external actors and external services that interact with the platform.
The primary users are guest users (unauthenticated) and authenticated users working individually or within collaborative workspaces.
External services include OAuth providers for federated login, an email service for verification and password reset flows, Stripe for subscription billing, an AI provider for summarization/insights, and AWS S3 for object storage.

\section{Use Case Diagram and Descriptive Forms}
\label{sec:use-case-diagram}

The use case diagram (Figure~\ref{fig:use-case-diagram}) summarizes the key interactions between system actors and core platform functions.
To support academic clarity and traceability, representative use cases are specified using structured descriptive forms.

\section{Data Flow Diagram (DFD)}
\label{sec:dfd}

The Data Flow Diagram (Figure~\ref{fig:dfd-diagram}) illustrates how data moves through \projectname{} processes and stores.
At a high level, the system receives user requests through the web client, performs authentication and authorization in the API layer, and persists results in the database and object storage.
The main processes include session management, workspace and membership operations, paper upload and processing, AI-driven analysis, and subscription management.

\subsection{DFD Notes (Process and Data Store Overview)}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,topsep=5pt,itemsep=3pt]
    \item \textbf{Processes}: authentication/session handling, workspace and collection management, paper ingestion and metadata extraction, AI summarization/insights, and billing operations.
    \item \textbf{Data Stores}: PostgreSQL stores structured entities (users, workspaces, papers, collections, memberships, AI artifacts, billing records), while AWS S3 stores uploaded documents and derived file assets.
    \item \textbf{External Interfaces}: OAuth providers and email services support identity verification workflows; Stripe manages subscription events; AI providers perform inference for summaries and insights.
\end{itemize}

\section{Activity Diagram}
\label{sec:activity-diagram}

The activity diagram (Figure~\ref{fig:activity-diagram}) captures the operational workflow for paper upload, validation, persistence, and completion.
It emphasizes validation points (file checks, field validation, authorization) and highlights the separation between user actions and backend processing responsibilities.

\section{ERD and Relational Schema Diagrams}
\label{sec:erd-and-schema}

The database design of \projectname{} is centered around the entities required for authentication, collaborative workspaces, paper management, and AI features.
The ERD (Figure~\ref{fig:system-erd}) visualizes the conceptual model and relationships, while the schema diagram (Figure~\ref{fig:system-schema}) represents the logical relational structure used in the PostgreSQL database.

\subsection{Core Entities and Relationships}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,topsep=5pt,itemsep=3pt]
    \item \textbf{User, Account, Session, UserToken}: authentication and OAuth linkage.
    \item \textbf{Workspace, WorkspaceMember}: collaborative boundaries and role-based membership.
    \item \textbf{Paper, PaperFile, PaperChunk}: paper storage, metadata, and chunking for downstream AI operations.
    \item \textbf{Collection, CollectionPaper, CollectionMember}: grouping of papers and controlled sharing.
    \item \textbf{AISummary}: persisted AI outputs associated with papers.
\end{itemize}
