## 📊 Measurement Commands

### Before Each Phase

```bash
# Capture baseline
npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000/dashboard --output=json > baseline-phase-X.json

# Check bundle size
cd apps/frontend && yarn build
```

### After Each Phase

```bash
# Run Lighthouse
npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000/dashboard --output=html --output-path=report-phase-X.html

# Compare scores
node scripts/compare-lighthouse.js baseline-phase-X.json report-phase-X.json
```

### Backend Testing

```bash
# Start backend with timing
cd apps/backend
NODE_ENV=development yarn dev

# Check query logs for slow queries (>100ms warnings)
```

## 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Performance score went down after optimization"

**Possible Causes:**

- Network conditions changed
- Different test environment
- Chrome extensions interfering

**Solution:**

- Run tests in incognito mode
- Run multiple tests and average
- Use Lighthouse CI for consistent results

### Issue: "Cache not working"

**Possible Causes:**

- Redis not connected
- Cache keys incorrectly generated
- TTL too short

**Solution:**

- Check Redis connection logs
- Verify cacheService.isEnabled() returns true
- Increase TTL temporarily to test

### Issue: "Queries still slow after indexing"

**Possible Causes:**

- Index not being used (check EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
- Query pattern doesn't match index
- Database statistics outdated

**Solution:**

- Run VACUUM ANALYZE
- Verify index with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- Adjust index to match query pattern

### Issue: "App breaks after lazy loading"

**Possible Causes:**

- Component relies on SSR
- Component has side effects in module scope
- Missing loading state

**Solution:**

- Add ssr: false to dynamic import
- Move side effects to useEffect
- Add proper loading component
